# ImageSearcher

This is the second assignment for the Android CodePath class. It took approximately 20-25 hours to complete the given user stories and optional advanced stories. The user stories included the ability to enter a search query that would display a grid of results from the Google Image API. The user could then click on “settings” to select advanced search options to filter the results, such as size (small, medium, large, extra-large), color filter (black, blue, brown, gray, green, etc…), type (faces, photo, clip art, line art), and site (espn.com). Subsequent searches had any applied filters to the search results. Users were also able to tap on any image in the results to see it in full-screen and scroll down “infinitely” to continue loading more image results, up to 8 pages. For the optional advanced user stories, robust error handling was implemented to check if internet was available, as well as handle error cases and network failures. Additionally, the ActionBar SearchView or custom layout was used as the query box instead of an EditText, and the Filter Settings Activity was replaced with a lightweight modal overlay.
